## Requirements
`Python2.7` minimum
A working Instagram account
(`instabot.py` file must be in `UTF-8` encoding if you use `Python 3`, or `ASCII` in `Python 2` ([PEP][3])!)

## Usage
#### Example of usage:
For example see `example.py`. Just change the login and password information with your own, then run `example.py` and the bot will start doing it's magic!

####1) Login:
Login automatic, as followed, by creating the `InstaBot` class element:
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password',
                like_per_day=1000,
                media_max_like=0,
                media_min_like=0,
                follow_per_day=0,
                follow_time=5*60*60,
                unfollow_per_day=0,
                comments_per_day=0,
                tag_list=['cat', 'car', 'dog'],
                max_like_for_one_tag = 5,
                unfollow_break_min = 15,
                unfollow_break_max = 30,
                log_mod = 0)
```

####2) Set likes and unlike:
How many likes set bot in one day. Default value is 1000 likes per 24 hours.
If you want to do more than 1000 likes in day - instagram can ban you.
Usually this bot is used 24/7 and it's default setup to distripute 1000 likes in day evenly. If you want more likes in one moment, set this parameter to 5000 or 10000 or more. Formula: set like with delay = `(24 hour * 60 minute * 60 second / like_per_day)`
######Be careful, don't set more than 1000 like in day or you can be banned! Be warned!!
```python
like_per_day=1000
```
Don't like media (photo or video) if it have more than `media_max_like` likes. `media_max_like = 0` will ignore this property. If media have too much likes - your like have not feedback.
Don't like media (photo or video) if it have less than `media_min_like` likes. `media_min_like = 0` will ignore this property.
```python
media_max_like=10
media_min_like=0
```
Tag list to like.
```python
tag_list = ['cat', 'car', 'dog']
```
Like 1 to `max_like_for_one_tag` times by row.
```python
max_like_for_one_tag=5
```

You can like one tag:
```python
bot.get_media_id_by_tag('dog')
```
Like 4 times:
```python
bot.like_all_exist_media(4)
```
Or you can choose `auto_mod` (like all tags from setting by loop):
```python
bot.auto_mod()
```
For unlike:
```python
bot.unlike('media_id')
```
####3) Set comments:
```python
bot.comment('media_id', 'comment')
```
For example:
```python
bot.comment(11111111111111111111, 'Cool!')
```
####4) Follow and unfollow:
Follow:
```python
bot.follow('user_id')
```
Unfollow:
```python
bot.unfollow('user_id')
```
For example (follow and unfollow user with id 111111111):
```python
bot.follow(111111111)
bot.unfollow(111111111)
```
####5) Else:
Log mod: `log_mod=0` log to console, `log_mod=1` log to file, `log_mod=2` no log.
```python
log_mod = 0
```
unfollow_break_min / unfollow_break_max: These define the randomly selected amount of time in seconds that it will pause between unfollows on a break.
Example:
```
unfollow_break_min = 15
unfollow_break_max = 30
```
This will cause a delay of anywhere between 15 to 30 seconds between every unfollow.
####6) Logout from exist session:
```python
bot.logout()
```
## Usage examples
Standard use (will like by loop, all default tag):
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password')
bot.auto_mod()
```
Standard use with your tag (will like by loop, all your tag):
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password', tag_list = ['with', 'your', 'tag'])
bot.auto_mod()
```
Standard use with change default settings (you should know what you do!):
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password',
               like_in_day=100000,
               media_max_like=50,
               media_min_like=5,
               tag_list = ['like', 'follow', 'girls'],
               max_like_for_one_tag=50,
               log_mod = 1)
bot.auto_mod()
```
Get media_id buy one tag `'python'` and like 4 of them:
```python
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password')
bot.get_media_id_by_tag('python')
bot.like_all_exist_media(4)
```

## How to install and run:

## Warning!

## Work with [InstagramAPI.py][4]
I rewrote, created by @mgp25 php class, to work with the instagram API. This class give ALL access to instagram (login, post photo/video, comment, follow, get followers and etc.). This class pretends device on android and can work like android APP. In future I will rewrite all this bot to InstagramAPI.py.

This class not ready for 100%, but I make most important things and you can work with it.

## Work with userinfo.py (does not work after June 1 2016)
If you want to get some user info (follower, following and etc.) Instagram don't give this info.
Class in `userinfo.py` aggregate this information, from other sites (now only from http://ink361.com/)
#### How to use:
```python
ui = UserInfo()
```
Search by `user_name` (need to get `user_id`, `user_name` if you don't know it):
```python
ui.search_user(user_name="danbilzerian")
```
or if you know `user_id` use `ui.search_user(user_id="50417061")`. Your result:
```python
print(ui.user_name)
print(ui.user_id)
```
Get following list with no limit
```python
ui.get_following()
print(ui.following)
```
Get followers list with limit 10:
```python
ui.get_followers(limit=10)
print(ui.followers)
```
